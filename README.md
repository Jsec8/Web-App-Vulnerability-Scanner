# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

This is a simple web application vulnerability scanner written in Python. It can detect several common web vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Open Redirects, Directory Traversal, Command Injection, and Local File Inclusion (LFI).

## Features

- SQL Injection detection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) detection
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) detection
- Open Redirect detection
- Directory Traversal detection
- Command Injection detection
- Local File Inclusion (LFI) detection
- Generates a detailed log file (`scanner.log`) with all the requests and responses for review

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jsec8/Web-App-Vulnerability-Scanner.git
    cd web-app-vulnerability-scanner
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the scanner:

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

2. Enter the URL of the web application you want to scan when prompted.

3. The scan results will be displayed on the console, and detailed logs of the scan will be available in the scanner.log file.

## Example

```bash
(vulnerability_scanner) $ python run.py
Enter the URL to scan: https://example.com
Scan results: {'sql_injection': True, 'xss': False, 'csrf': False, 'open_redirect': True, 'directory_traversal': False, 'command_injection': False, 'lfi': False}
